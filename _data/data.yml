    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Welcome to my website! I'm Reto, a computational biologist from Basel, Switzerland. 
      Here, I share my academic and professional career path with you. Let me know if something catches your interest!
      
      My current research focuses on evolution of antibiotic resistance. 
      This is crucial to combat the increasing threat of drug-resistant bacterial infections, 
      which can lead to higher mortality rates and healthcare costs. 
      I combine experimental and computational approaches to obtain new insights into this exciting and essential field.
